I am a former industrial designer, living in Japan and now turning my career into that of a full-stack web developer. 

I took on learning coding with Le Wagon in the Web development bootcamp and now, mixing my skills as a designer I am able to build codes with working features, responsive websites and take on projects as a product manager; being there to serve my team as a TL and work together in the completion of a product.
