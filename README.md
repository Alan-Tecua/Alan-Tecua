### Hello there! I'm Alan ðŸ‘‹

I am a former industrial designer, living in Japan and now turning my career into that of a full-stack web developer. 

For that reason I took on learning coding and mixing my cultivated skills as a designer. I can build codes with working features, responsive websites and take on projects as a product manager, being there to serve my team as a TL and work together in the completion of a product.
